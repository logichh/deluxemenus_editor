How to work with this?

1) download all files and put them in 1 folder
2) open terminal in that folder and run "npm install", this will install all dependancies
3) make changes to the code
4) for localhost web preview run "npm run dev" in the same terminal
5) for building and an app ready for deploying anywhere, run "npm run build"


do not ask me what does what in the code, figure it out yourself
it is very very spaghetti code
